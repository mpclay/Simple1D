For the convergence studies, the following parameters were used in Simple1D:

   1.  Advection equation
   2.  L = 2.0
   3.  xstart = 0.0
   4.  n = 16, 32, 64, ...
   5.  k = 2 and k = 3
   6.  A constant dt of 0.000001
   7.  An end time of 2.0, which corresponds to one flow-through time.
   8.  Sinusoidal initial conditions.
   9.  Wave speed a = 1.0 (see point 7).
   10. Periodic boundary conditions.

With these settings, the code is solving for one flow-through time of the linear
advection equation with varying grid resolutions and WENO reconstruction orders.
At the end of the simulation, the l2 and l-infinity errors are calculated
relative to the initial conditions, and are used to calculate the convergence
orders reported in the Convergence-k-2.dat and Convergence-k-3.dat files.
